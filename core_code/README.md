This is a simplified code of the ShapeFormer project, which contains model code and hyperparameters for the core models.

The main file for ShapeFormer and VQDIF models are in 'shapeformer/shapeformer.py' and 'vqdif/vqdif.py' respectively.
Their configuration yaml files are in this directoy.

The callback class in the bottom of these files are used to sample/reconstruct the 3D shape and render them to images.

The environment.yaml describe a super-set of the libraries that is used in the core code. We will simplify it in the future.

We will release the complete code after it cleaning up.
